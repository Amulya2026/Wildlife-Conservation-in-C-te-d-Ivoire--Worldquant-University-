# Wildlife-Conservation-in-C-te-d-Ivoire--Worldquant-University-
In this project, you'll classify animals in wildlife preserve images using deep learning. You'll learn to read and process images, build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with PyTorch, make predictions on new data, and prepare a submission for a data science competition.
The Project is divided in three parts -
Image as Data
Binary Classification 
Multiclass Classification
